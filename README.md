# README

This webapp imitates a helpdesk for a fictional tech support company, Green Leaf Squad.

Clients of the company can file tickets with their issue. A professional with the company can respond to their concern. 
In addition, professionals can leave internal comments on the ticket for other professionals to view.

Passwords are hashed for a minimal level of authentication.

This help desk webapp is built with Rails, some Bootstrap and SQLite3.
